$faction.id == takeshido",,"Some racers treat you with respect, others... not so much. At least they've heard of you.",,
relLevelFavorabletakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == FAVORABLE
$faction.id == takeshido",,"You've got cred with a few Takeshido pilots, but their more hardcore racers still think you're slow. Some Takeshido mechanics may be inclined to drop off some excess parts for you, if you've got the credits.",,
relLevelWelcomingtakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == WELCOMING
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Your rep as a skilled pilot is known throughout Takeshido, for better or for worse. You've got some fans, but some pilots still think you're a poser. On the bright side, some mechanics are willing to tune your ships or sell you new ones.",,
relLevelFriendlytakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == FRIENDLY
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Your feats of speed and risk have finally gotten through to even the most jaded of Takeshido pilots. You might not be the fastest around, but nearly everyone has heard good things about you. Mechanics seek you out for the opportunity to tune your ships, and industrialists from Nosu are happy to fill ship orders for you.",,
relLevelCooperativetakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == COOPERATIVE
$faction.id == takeshido",,"In Takeshido, respect is the ultimate currency, and you've got loads of it. Some of the quickest and most daring pilots in Takeshido see you as a peer, and when you show up to a race, the bookies shift their odds. Legendary forges from Ninami make custom components for your ships, and your many backroom dealings with Nasu factory owners put you on a first-name basis with them. The legend himself, Hiro Kao, considers you a friend and frequently trusts you with important Takeshido jobs.",,
relLevelSuspicioustakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == SUSPICIOUS
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Takeshido seems to trust you about as much as they trust anyone else in the sector, which is to say not much. They probably won't attack you directly, but if one of their captains were to pass on your coordinates to a local pirate gang for a quick buck, it wouldn't be unheard of.",,
relLevelInhospitabletakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == INHOSPITABLE
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Your name is spoken with disgust among Takeshido captains, and some of their more mischievous racers make it a habit to mess with you. No mechanics will see you, and you're on a blacklist for attending or viewing any Takeshido-run races.",,
relLevelHostiletakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == HOSTILE
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Your constant attacks against Takeshido have made taking you down something worthy of respect. You can expect plenty of up-and-coming Takeshido racers on the hunt for you, and if you find yourself in Takeshido space, you'd do well to have your weapons at the ready.",,
relLevelVengefultakeshido,RelationshipLevelDesc,"$faction.rel == VENGEFUL
$faction.id == takeshido",,"Your acts against Takeshido are unforgivable, and Hiro himself has put out a hit on you. The only races you'll be seeing now are those to see which Takeshido daredevil can kill you first.",,
