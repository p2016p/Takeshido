takeshido,FACTION,"In the aftermath of the Second AI War, tensions between the major factions gradually settled, and a fragile peace held throughout the sector. This peace, however, made room for certain enterprising individuals to carve out a niche for themselves while the major governments were focused on their internal affairs. In a strategically uninteresting star system named Meiyo, a number of such individuals gathered and began to organize both legal and illegal races. Through a few years of headhunting the brightest and craziest mechanics in the sector, a faction led by the eccentric Hiro Kao took form in the Meiyo system and began to produce high-quality racing ships.

The budding faction of racers took the name Takeshido, after an Old Earth street-racing group by the same name. Hiro Kao himself even claimed that he was a descendant of the legendary Kenji Kao, an ancient street racer that allegedly ruled the scene for years until a fatal crash. Hiro aims to return the long-forgotten ""car culture"" to the sector in an updated form, racing high-powered starships across interstellar vacuum instead of cars across the tarmac.

To this end, Takeshido pilots regularly tune their already excessively fast ships right up to redline, and the Meiyo system has a well-funded RnD industry focused on churning out everything and anything in the way of speed. Of course, the credits do have to come from somewhere, and Takeshido has developed a good reputation as contraband smugglers, simply using their souped-up ships to outrun any authorities that try to catch them. Thus far, their record has been nearly spotless, managing to leave everything from Hegemony task groups to Remnant ordos in their dust.",,,
