#Faction
takeshido,FACTION,"In the aftermath of the Second AI War, tensions between the major factions gradually settled, and a fragile peace held throughout the sector. This peace, however, made room for certain enterprising individuals to carve out a niche for themselves while the major governments were focused on their internal affairs. In a strategically uninteresting star system named Meiyo, a number of such individuals gathered and began to organize both legal and illegal races. Through a few years of headhunting the brightest and craziest mechanics in the sector, a faction led by the eccentric Hiro Kao took form in the Meiyo system and began to produce high-quality racing ships.

The budding faction of racers took the name Takeshido, after an Old Earth street-racing group by the same name. Hiro Kao himself even claimed that he was a descendant of the legendary Kenji Kao, an ancient street racer that allegedly ruled the scene for years until a fatal crash. Hiro aims to return the long-forgotten ""car culture"" to the sector in an updated form, racing high-powered starships across interstellar vacuum instead of cars across the tarmac.

To this end, Takeshido pilots regularly tune their already excessively fast ships right up to redline, and the Meiyo system has a well-funded RnD industry focused on churning out everything and anything in the way of speed. Of course, the credits do have to come from somewhere, and Takeshido has developed a good reputation as contraband smugglers, simply using their souped-up ships to outrun any authorities that try to catch them. Thus far, their record has been nearly spotless, managing to leave everything from Hegemony task groups to Remnant ordos in their dust.",,,

takeshido_hobi_custom,SHIP,"Although the Hobi had humble beginnings as an everyday Old Earth civilian vehicle, it quickly became a favorite among street racers for its simple but hardy frame, which easily accommodates extensive additions, as well as its legendary 3kX engine which could withstand the worst of the ill-advised modifications that its owners subjected them to. In the common era, Takeshido pilots regularly field modified Hobis as makeshift fighters and bombers, and Takeshido fleets often keep at least one hypermodified Hobi around as a testbed for experimental engine upgrades.",,,
takeshido_camirillo_custom,SHIP,"In its heyday, the Camirillo line of cars were the envy of young adult men everywhere, revered for their high power, stunning looks, and everlasting reliability. Unfortunately, a plethora of new legislation to protect the environment resulted in the Camirillo line being put out of production, but that didn't stop those who had them from gleefully continuing their generous contribution to Earth's already-immense pollution issues. Nowadays, surviving Camirillos and painstakingly reproduced replicas are the envy of Takeshido engineers; their vast engine bays and several times redundant structural components make them ideal for interstellar retrofits and mounting explosive ordnance, though their relative weight makes them somewhat more sluggish than other Takeshido customs.",,,
takeshido_350x_custom,SHIP,"The original profile of the 350x was designed to assist with its aerodynamics, but its designers had no idea how much of a boon this would prove to be in the vehicle's future. Its unique body design meant that the 350x was one of the first vehicles that were retrofitted with the advent of hovering cars, and when the next wave of interstellar retrofits came about, the 350x was once again among the forerunners. Its wings were initially vestiges from the first round of retrofits, but now they greatly enhance suborbital maneuverability while housing some extra ordnance, despite greatly adding to the bulk of the improvised strikecraft.",,,
takeshido_bionda_custom,SHIP,"Drug kingpins, A-list actors, international arms dealers, corrupt politicians, supermodels, and overpaid beachside cops were the target demographic for the infamous Bionda, a true masterclass in form. Fiera's commitment to the finer things in life meant that the Bionda instantly became a status symbol for all of the most charismatic characters of its time and beyond. Its legendary style alone makes it the envy of any fleet commander with taste, to say nothing of its superbly engineered retrofits.",,,
takeshido_BR97_custom,SHIP,"Despite its uncanny resemblance to an Old Earth vehicle of a similar designation, the BR97 is actually a post-collapse innovation. One surprisingly efficient flux grid, one passenger on a light armament, space in the back for larger guns, and enough acceleration to decimate anything in the sector in a quarter mile: the BR97 may look old, but its performance is years ahead.",,,
takeshido_bonta_custom,SHIP,"Fieras may have been the kings of style, but if there was one manufacturer which gave them a run for their money then it would be Mivelli. After being snubbed in a business deal by Fransisco Fiera himself, Antonio Mivelli made it his mission to put Fiera out of business. Antonio never achieved his dream, but his company made some very fine cars in the process, the undoubted pinnacle of which was the Bonta, a futuristic-looking automobile with exceptional performance that came close to the Bionda's at a much cheaper price. In today's Persean Sector, things haven't changed much for the Bonta; its specifications, battlefield effectiveness, and looks are all perfect rivals for Bianda retrofits but come at a cheaper (if still exorbitant) price tag.",,,
takeshido_NMW_G3_custom,SHIP,"Nosu Motor Works is perhaps the most reputable company in the sector still making high performance terrestrial vehicles in the sector today. The fact that the majority of manufacturing in the sector is devoted to construction vehicles and spaceships does of course have a major impact on that claim, however, that's not to say that NMW doesn't produce some exceptional vehicles; Nicknamed 'The Beamer', the NMW G3 is a finely tuned racing machine purpose built for pilots that want to face down enemy fleets, wow adoring fans when they dock at port, and look damn good while doing so.",,,
takeshido_vroomicorn_custom,SHIP,"The Vroomicorn is the result of one of Takeshido's most infamous and successful street racers and his unyielding desire to never lose; after half a fortune spent in RnD and one ill fated test run which claimed the life of 17 the Vroomicorn was born. This hunk of turbos, superchargers, flux circuits, and exhausts can give you what mystical men refer to as an out of body experience, the sheer acceleration of this craft leaves some of its pilots in a near permanent fugue state while out of it, evidently unable to cope with such a slow paced world.",,,
takeshido_hobi_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified Hobi interceptor cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Downsized machine guns excel at point defense and applying shield pressure, but do minimal damage to armored targets.

Although the Hobi had humble beginnings as an everyday Old Earth civilian vehicle, it quickly became a favorite among street racers for its simple but hardy frame, which easily accommodates extensive additions, as well as its legendary 3kX engine which could withstand the worst of the ill-advised modifications that its owners subjected them to. In the common era, Takeshido pilots regularly field modified Hobis as makeshift fighters and bombers, and Takeshido fleets often keep at least one hypermodified Hobi around as a testbed for experimental engine upgrades.",,,
takeshido_camirillo_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified Camirillo bomber cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Dual hammer torpedoes, improvised shields, and high speed make it the bane of Hegemony patrols. Sneered at as a pirate's imitation of the mighty Trident, with hefty logistical burdens and lengthy replacement times to match.

In its heyday, the Camirillo line of cars were the envy of young adult men everywhere, revered for their high power, stunning looks, and everlasting reliability. Unfortunately, a plethora of new legislation to protect the environment resulted in the Camirillo line being put out of production, but that didn't stop those who had them from gleefully continuing their generous contribution to Earth's already-immense pollution issues.

takeshido_350x_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified 350x long range bomber cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Capable of raining down volleys of bombs that blows up fighter formations, the 350x excels at heckling attack formations. However, long replacement times confound this otherwise excellent harasser.

The original profile of the 350x was designed to assist with its aerodynamics, but its designers had no idea how much of a boon this would prove to be in the vehicle's future. Its unique body design meant that the 350x was one of the first vehicles that were retrofitted with the advent of hovering cars, and when the next wave of interstellar retrofits came about, the 350x was once again among the forerunners.

takeshido_BR97_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified BR97 anti-ship strikecraft cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. While capable of point defense and interception, the BR97 excels at pressuring shields with light needler fire, allowing friendly ships to score easy kills.

Despite its uncanny resemblance to an Old Earth vehicle of a similar designation, the BR97 is actually a post-collapse innovation. One surprisingly efficient flux grid, one passenger on a light armament, space in the back for larger guns, and enough acceleration to decimate anything in the sector in a quarter mile: the BR97 may look old, but its performance is years ahead.",,,
takeshido_NMW_G3_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified NMW heavy anti-ship strikecraft cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. The high speeds of fighter combat make it difficult to focus the phase lance, but the NMW remains a potent if fragile machine.

Nosu Motor Works is perhaps the most reputable company in the sector still making high performance terrestrial vehicles in the sector today. The fact that the majority of manufacturing in the sector is devoted to construction vehicles and spaceships does of course have a major impact on that claim, however, that's not to say that NMW doesn't produce some exceptional vehicles; Nicknamed 'The Beamer', the NMW G3 is a finely tuned racing machine purpose built for pilots that want to face down enemy fleets, wow adoring fans when they dock at port, and look damn good while doing so.",,,
takeshido_vroomicorn_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified Vroomicon strikecraft cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Expensive and difficult to replace quickly, but shows excellent performance against all target types.

The Vroomicorn is the result of one of Takeshido's most infamous and successful street racers and his unyielding desire to never lose; after half a fortune spent in RnD and one ill fated test run which claimed the life of 17 the Vroomicorn was born.
