The demons which our glorious Ludd spoke of are far more prevalent in this sector than we could ever have imagined. Beings far beyond reproach linger among sources of vast energy, harnessing them for machinations undoubtedly in the service of the great cataclysm.

The many sins of the vile Epta Consortium are well known to us, however, this is by far the most grievous of them all. They have communed with the great agents of the cataclysm, they have crafted an ark in which to receive a gift, and they have anointed an accursed warrior. Should this warrior be allowed to complete his pilgrimage the end of all things shall surely be upon us.

Gather your flocks and meet me to quench this evil flame before it becomes a burning inferno. You should need not see this outcome in order to fear it; blessed is he who may believe without seeing
