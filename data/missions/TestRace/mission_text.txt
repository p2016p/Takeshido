Location: Far edge of the Persean sector

It's a fine time to be a Hegemony fleet captain. While it is true that the sector could be in a better spot overall, among all the spots possible in it, commanding an array of ships for the strongest faction certainly ranks fairly highly; that was Admiral Johan's theory anyway.

So why was it that things were just so darn... boring. 3 cycles of hunting outlaws, 3 more as the strategic defense coordinator of Jangala, and 3 more on top of that as the commander of what some would consider to be the most efficient long range strike fleet in the sector and somehow all it had gotten him was scouting duty. It wasn't that he was ungrateful for what the Hegemony had done for him, but simply that, as a man of action, it was hard for him to find joy in the tedium of going from system to system in the hopes of finding a planet that, by his estimation at least, would never be colonized anyway. He just wished that there was something to spice things up a bit...

And then, out of the corner of his eye, it's there.
