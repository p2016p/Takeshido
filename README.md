# DISCLAIMER

To depict is not to condone: a variety of political views and structures are represented, some of which the creators may agree with, and some of which the creators may very strongly disagree with. Often they may be presented in ways that those who practice those beliefs may like to see themselves, with further context given elsewhere in the narrative. Suffice to say that we do not support acts of genocide, censorship, slavery, or totalitarianism of any sort generally.

That's rather too serious sounding for a video game mod that's supposed to be fun first and foremost, but you gotta account for everything. We do be living in a society.

# CODE CREDITS

Listing these here so we don't forget:

Wisp for a lot of basic help with IDE setup and getting started. Also his quest code, and generally being a great guy.

Histidine, also for quest code, some github help, and being very responsive about how his code works.

PureTilt, also quite helpful. Viral bombing code was an important reference.

Harmful Mechanic also offered a lot of help and guidance to intel, industry, etc.

Jannes, for expert help on...a lot of bullshit. Like kotlin. And AI. Advanced Gunnery useful to look at. Helpful dude.

Matt Damon, for helpful feedback and advice. 

Gettag, for help with hullsize swapping.

BadDragn has a lot of excellent code on an open license. WhichMod was useful to look at, as was targeting code for quark-gluons. Lots of good things.

Ruddygreat, just for a lot of different things. Seriously, always something cursed, what with the armor and the string handling and the deployments. 

Tomatopaste, for help with OpenGL and walking through campaign-level setup, as well spriting suggestions.

Schaf the sheep, for Voidtech UI code.

Ava, for expert knowledge about who has done what before, and what mods to look at for reference.

Tart, for his patience.

DR, for letting us loot his imperium tester code, as well as having a lot of great ideas that inspired us. Skinshields are nice.

Banano of Doom, for great code helping, specially with the Storm Pulser weapon, as well spriting suggestions and patience.

Lortus, Kirbo, Arthr, Maelstrom, Pyrophage and overall Spaceport Corvus community for spriting help, suggestions and incentives to continue and improve.


...there's other people who've helped or whose code we've read that I've forgotten to list here. Notes about other mods that were examined are scattered in code-comments, but I never bothered to keep a central list of everything we referenced.
