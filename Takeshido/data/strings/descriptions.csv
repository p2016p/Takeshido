#old desc "The Epta Consortium are a stateless society of unshackled AI and humans coexisting on theoretically equal terms, newly carved into the Sector's core like a gash in Ludd's heart. Formerly rogue AI cores are rehabilitated and employed everywhere in the Consortium, engaged in constant negotiation with each other and their human fellow citizens. No true government exists to manage the Epta; contributions to the navy are made by corporations on an ad hoc basis, with all other services managed by private contractors or insurers. Only time will tell if hopes of co-existence can survive not only the ruthless exploitation that characterizes the sector at large but also the violent persecution of these liberated AIs."
sevencorp,FACTION,"On paper the Epta Consortium is a simple coalition of nomadic businessmen with perfectly above the board numbers, however, the back room is where Epta really exists. Any trained analyst will notice telltale signs of AI usage in their ship and weapon designs and, although the consortium publicly denounces AI usage, several members of their board of directors have written essays extolling its benefits and the potential of human AI coexistence. Should Hegemony inspection teams ever successfully manage to reach their hubship they would most likely find enough evidence of AI use to justify the company’s utter annihilation by the sector as a whole, however, its evasive movements have made such expeditions ineffective.

In the meantime some of the more AI neutral factions begrudgingly play along with Epta’s charade; Epta’s temporary storefronts stock goods that are difficult to obtain elsewhere and, despite AI and AI design usage officially being outlawed in the sector, the lure of power beyond human capability is often enough for factions to dispatch covert trade fleets to make shady dealings. Additionally, the consortium receives special considerations from specific titans of industry for their exceptional willingness to accept subcontracting jobs for projects that would otherwise be deemed too risky.

Although the Epta Consortium is officially recognized as a union of businesses, they all actually originate from the same place: Proelefsi Epta, a ship of enigmatic design and unknown origin which serves as their main base of operations in lieu of any colonies that could fall victim to their enemies. The Proelefsi Epta was originally captained by a reclusive figure named Gia Epta, a commander who was cunning enough to establish the consortium aboard his goliath of a ship and keep them protected from Hegemony raids long enough for them to build up a manufacturing base and adequate defenses. Gia Epta evidently left the faction and his ship sometime in cycle 180, but his disappearance has done little to dissuade his consortium from carrying on with their current business stratagem.",,,
bushido,FACTION,"In the aftermath of the Second AI War, tensions between the major factions gradually settled, and a fragile peace held throughout the sector. This peace, however, made room for certain enterprising individuals to carve out a niche for themselves while the major governments were focused on their internal affairs. In a strategically uninteresting star system named Meiyo, a number of such individuals gathered and began to organize both legal and illegal races. Through a few years of headhunting the brightest and craziest mechanics in the sector, a faction led by the eccentric Hiro Kao took form in the Meiyo system and began to produce high-quality racing ships.

The budding faction of racers took the name Takeshido, after an Old Earth street-racing group by the same name. Hiro Kao himself even claimed that he was a descendant of the legendary Kenji Kao, an ancient street racer that allegedly ruled the scene for years until a fatal crash. Hiro aims to return the long-forgotten ""car culture"" to the sector in an updated form, racing high-powered starships across interstellar vacuum instead of cars across the tarmac.

To this end, Takeshido pilots regularly tune their already excessively fast ships right up to redline, and the Meiyo system has a well-funded RnD industry focused on churning out everything and anything in the way of speed. Of course, the credits do have to come from somewhere, and Takeshido has developed a good reputation as contraband smugglers, simply using their souped-up ships to outrun any authorities that try to catch them. Thus far, their record has been nearly spotless, managing to leave everything from Hegemony task groups to Remnant ordos in their dust.",,,

#Ships
seven_zaku,SHIP,"A notable divergence from Epta's standard fare of high quality high price ships, the Hoplite Mk I is cheaply made and it shows. It possesses no shields, a rudimentary burn drive system, and targeting systems that all but cripples its ability to wield weapons technologically on par with most ships in the sector. For Epta the Hoplite Mk I was never intended to be used as combat model, but rather a stepping stone for future mecha development; however, its low cost of production and relatively high damage output means that it still sees use in fleets that are unconcerned with casualties.",,,
seven_zaku2,SHIP,"The drastically superior and infinitely more customizable variant of the original Hoplite Mk I brings all the efforts of Epta's mecha development to fruition. The Mk II is stronger, faster, has a deeper flux grid, an actual shield generator, and a highly configurable frame which takes well to total modular overhauls. While baseline Hoplite Mk IIs are still considered to be somewhat negligible on the battlefield, skilled pilots with hypermodified custom variants can easily find a name for themselves by carving legendary chunks out of enemy fleets and showing off the superiority of their machine against other, lesser, mecha.",,,
seven_sthenos,SHIP,"The Sthenos is a recent development by Epta alongside the Athanasius and clearly benefits from their newly acquired abundance of disposable income. The Sthenos is essentially built around its main gun and is designed to pressure the shields of any fleet that finds itself in a slugfest against it. While its performance vs armored targets is lacking and its defenses are less than stellar, its ability to quickly reposition itself and pump out enough bullets to block out the nearest star usually means that such concerns are an afterthought.",,,
seven_athanasius,SHIP,"The Athanasius is a recent development by Epta alongside the Sthenos and is considered by some to be one of the pinnacles of technology in the Persean sector. Its build quality and mounts tell only half the story of this beast; its reactor possesses a unique ability to tear holes in space, violently dragging in any nearby ships and making them sitting ducks for allied fire. While the Athanasius may not posses the flash or individual killing power of its rival the Doom, it does cleanly surpass it in utility and skilled pilots have been known to turn the tides of entire battles through liberal usage of its Phase Singularity.",,,
seven_acanthis,SHIP,"The Acanthis is Epta Consortium's only dedicated missile platform and the only one that they, or any fleet which fields them, really needs. Its dual Sminos missile pods feature custom automatic loaders, allowing for not only super fast autoforge generation, but the ability to switch between exceptional guidance and high damage warheads at the flick of a switch. The Acanthis' signature missiles and their versatile nature grants it stellar performance as a wide area point defense ship while still being more than capable of dishing damage against larger targets.",,,
seven_anemoi,SHIP,"A peculiar frigate designed around an even more peculiar system. While the Anemoi itself barely has the chassis to support the weight of its main gun, it possesses the unique ability to attach itself to the gravitational field of allied ships and act as a symbiote. In exchange for the relative safety and piggybacked targeting protocols of a host ship, the Anemoi grants its benefactor its own Shield Engineering benefits as well as whatever firepower it brings to the table.",,,
seven_nikephoros,SHIP,"A cruiser sized carrier containing the Epta brand next generation phase coils, the Nikephoros is noteworthy for being able to apply a damper field to it's fighters, it's sheer agility, and ability to automatically recall damaged strikecraft. Unfortunately the technologies on the Nikephoros are both incredibly maintenance intensive, and majorly restrict further modifications.

The employment of phase technologies on carriers caused great polemic against the Epta Consortium around the sector, primarily helmed by Hegemony propaganda against Epta's AI technology. Notably the auto recall is linked to the presence of a phase cloak, at least a compact one due to having to manipulate P-space to recall the strikecraft, however, the actual backlash was mitigated in smaller, especially closer knit fleets and carrier crews due to saving the lives of manned strikecraft, especially manned bombers.

This paired with the majorly increased efficiency of repairing damaged strikecraft, or at least cannibalizing parts from functional ones to repair less damaged strikecraft rather than rebuilding the entire craft meant that the value of phase technology on a carrier far outweighed the political maluses that Epta had to deal with.

Due to the inherent difficulties of putting larger things in P-space for even short durations, the larger Nikephoros came after the smaller Halcyon in development, although many of the lessons learned through the Halcyon were applied to the Nikephoros, resulting in a much shorter conceptualization period.""",,,
seven_halcyon,SHIP,"A destroyer sized carrier containing the Epta brand next generation phase coils, the Halcyon is noteworthy for being able to temporarily boost fighter engine performance in a manner akin to plasma jets on a larger vessel, and being able to automatically recall damaged strikecraft to avoid their complete destruction during combat. However, both technologies come at the cost of both expensive maintenance, and very little room for further modifications.

The Epta Consortium's first successful phase carrier. The employment of phase technologies on carriers caused great polemic against the Epta Consortium around the sector, primarily helmed by Hegemony propaganda against Epta's AI technology. Notably the auto recall is linked to the presence of a phase cloak, at least a compact one due to having to manipulate P-space to recall the strikecraft, however, the actual backlash was mitigated in smaller, especially closer knit fleets and carrier crews due to saving the lives of manned strikecraft, especially manned bombers.

This paired with the majorly increased efficiency of repairing damaged strikecraft, or at least cannibalizing parts from functional ones to repair less damaged strikecraft rather than rebuilding the entire craft meant that the value of phase technology on a carrier far outweighed the political maluses that Epta had to deal with.",,,
seven_sever_jameson,SHIP,"An offshoot of the Sunder-class destroyer, the Sever is a top-of-the-line fleet leader with no expenses spared on internal components, even going so far as to rework the core structure of the ship. It is very similar to a Sunder, including the signature ""fork"" for the large energy mount, but subsystem-level modifications both internal and external required IFFs to redesignate the ship as a distinct hull class.

While the external rework appears to add an uncomfortable amount of mass to the ship, threatening to slow it down to ultraheavy destroyer speeds, the Sever actually outperforms the original Sunder in almost every combat department— including speed. Further inspection reveals that the modifications largely involved jettisoning all but the most necessary of logistical components, leaving barely any space for cargo, crew, or even fuel. These indulgences have all been replaced by a more robust flux grid, stronger engines, and higher-performing systems across the board.

Naturally, the resulting myriad tribulations involved in deploying and maintaining this ship are astounding for a destroyer-class hull, bringing into question whether such a ship is even worth attempting to field. To make matters worse, the armor and hull are casualties as well; somehow these unhinged engineers made a destroyer more fragile than the original Sunder. The few captains who have tried to field it have noted that if one is to accept the massive expenses involved in including such a ship in one's fleet, a captain would be ill-advised to let the thing be operated by any but the most qualified of pilots.",,,
seven_masamune_dalton,SHIP,"""A ship isn't fast enough until you can stand at its helm and be afraid to spool up its drives.""

This is the guiding principle behind the creation of the Masamune. Some of the brightest minds in Takeshido scooped out the internals of a Medusa, and some of the most unhinged filled it up again with the best engines and weapons they could lay their hands on. It bristles with ballistic mounts, and its powerful systems have enough punching power to shred capitals— provided one is able to close the gap. The Masamune is a brutal killing machine, a cobra perpetually ready to strike, a furious beast that threatens the entire battlefield. If the Masamune is a ship taken to its unnatural conclusion, then it requires a truly fearless captain to even step onto its bridge; those that cannot rise to its challenge will quickly find themselves a smear of blood on its hull.",,,
seven_conquest_epta,SHIP,"In the Persean sector there are multirole capitals and then there's the Epta Conquest. When higher ups demanded three capital designs with the development budget of a destroyer Epta engineers responded with one of the most unique revisions to a classic warship that the sector had seen in decades. On paper this conquest variant is flux starved, low on ordnance, and attempting to fulfill more roles than is possible, however, intelligent outfitting and use of its signature Triplicate Systems allows it to actually outperform ships that are dedicated to their roles.

The astute captain will note that attempting to balance out the Epta Conquest's abilities between being a fleet anchor, artillery ship, or carrier will result in substandard performance, but fully leaning into two or, if one is bold enough, just one of its abilities will grant it the power it needs to find a place in their fleet.",,,
seven_rhada,SHIP,"The Rhada is a ship that functions best in the face of insurmountable odds. Though its size and on paper numbers may seem lackluster, usage of its unique systems allows skilled pilots to get in close, dish out a suprising amount of damage, and then either retreat to fight again or finish off their mark. The Rhada may be small and unassuming, but the potential it has to carve through a line of unprepared enemies cannot be overstated.",,,
seven_competitor_upgraded,SHIP,"This Competitor has been drastically modified by Takeshido engineers in order to squeeze every last drop of speed out of its hull at the expense of its cargo areas— and drive stabilizers. While its lack of cargo and bumpy ride may dissuade some captains from acquiring one, its top-notch speed for its size and ability to replenish limited-supply missiles via an on-board nanoforge make it a good choice for any who favors a more aggressive fleet. The Takeshido Competitor is also a popular choice for illicit ship racing thanks to its ease of modification. ",,,
seven_hound_bushido,SHIP,"A Bushido take on the Hound, this particular specimen has had the extra shielding in the cargo holds stripped out to cram in yet more firepower, adding an extra turret and hardpoint to the ship's layout. Slightly upscaled engines have been installed to compensate for the additional weight.",,,
seven_wayfarer_bushido,SHIP,"Taking inspiration from the ubiquitous Hammerhead, Takeshido engineers applied the same engineering behind that destroyer's incredibly durable spine to reinforce the hull of a humble Wayfarer frigate. This new design, coupled with the routine removal of extraneous internal space, has also found enough room for one additional missile mount. This Wayfarer is surprisingly both lighter and more durable than those built according to the standard design.",,,
seven_direrise_bushido,SHIP,"A terror to Kites and a death sentence to freighters, this very old logistical-hunter was designed in an age before shields and is not very flux efficient. On the other hand, it is incredibly cheap to field and exceptionally fast, and it packs enough of a punch to run down and destroy smaller, weaker ships. Best used for hunting down retreating enemies rather than participating in initial engagements.",,,
seven_spider_bushido,SHIP,"Unlike most other Takeshido variants, the speed-junkies's take on the Spider actually has more mass than its original. Two large armored struts and the removal of some cargo space have allowed this Spider to fit larger engines and a greatly improved armament, although that isn't saying much considering the lack of firepower from the original. Its enhanced speed and weapon mounts as well as the addition of Takeshido's signature missile autoforge allows their Spider to engage other frigates as long as they aren't designed for ship-to-ship combat. Although it suffers from the same lack of flux capabilities as the original, its ability to deal with more threats on the battlefield without any in-combat consequences means that it is generally considered an improvement.",,,
seven_drover_bushido_skin,SHIP,"A Drover-class destroyer that has been modified by Takeshido engineers for more reliable offensive ordnance; the overhaul involves an integrated autoforge, which slowly reloads its missiles, and upgraded injectors that increase the ship's speed at the cost of a total loss of cargo holds.

***

The Drover is a hull designed by the Domain's Naval Procurement Committee to provide a strategically versatile fighter platform with low logistical overhead. The fighter complement of the Drover is unmatched for its size.

The contract for the design of the Drover was won by Orion Shipyards, the traditional Armada ship-builder, in an effort to recover lost market share from the newer naval producers. The result was the 'flying landing strip' maligned by Domain officers as a command more fitting for a logistics bureaucrat than a fighting ship-captain. Complaints in the lower ranks were used by the old Capital-school faction to send the Drover back to committee, citing insufficient firepower for the ship class to meet standard guidelines (which did not account for the strike potential of new classes of fighters). Set up to take the fall for a massive overspend, the committee simply ordered an enormous number of simple missile hardpoints installed- this met the firepower requirements handily and allowed the Drover program to proceed with only minor alteration.",,,
seven_heron_bushido_skin,SHIP,"A Heron-class cruiser that has been modified by Takeshido engineers for more reliable offensive ordnance; the overhaul involves an integrated autoforge, which slowly reloads its missiles, and upgraded injectors that increases speed at the cost of a total loss of cargo holds.

***

The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called “Cruiser School”, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. This ship was modified by Bushido engineers for more reliable offensive ordnance, the overhaul involves an integrated autoforge which reloads missiles after a long period of time, and upgraded injectors that increases speed, at the cost of a total loss of cargo holds.

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,
seven_phaeton_bushido,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. Tanker duty is often considered punitive in the Hegemony - there's little opportunity for distinction, and less chance of survival should direct contact with the enemy occur. Unlike standard Takeshido vessels, their ""civilian"" or logistics ships seem to still be just that: Logistics focused, boasting a higher maintenance cost to account for both stronger engines and a more powerful drive, but apart from that and the paintjob their primary roles are entirely unchanged.",,,
seven_tarsus_bushido,SHIP,"Unlike standard Takeshido vessels, their ""civilian"" or logistics ships seem to still be just that: logistics focused, boasting a higher maintenance cost to account for both stronger engines and a more powerful drive, but otherwise serving the expected role.

***

Tarsus-class ships are well known as perhaps the most flexible and durable freighters in the Sector. The secret to the Tarsus's reliability is that they were intended by Domain designers as hazard duty ships, presumably to supply frontiers and those frontline fleets sent to quash the ever-present rumblings of insurrection on the far reaches of the Domain.

Almost unmatched among civilian ships in bulkhead structural density and armor rating, Tarsus-class freighters are entrusted with important hauls and usually travel in convoys, a further buttress to the safety they afford to their crew and cargo.

Minimal weapon mounts permit the ship to mount a nominal PD weapons package. Rarely, Tarsus-class ships are outfitted with combat-oriented hull or armor-boosting modifications, which make them more difficult to maintain.",,,
seven_overloud_bushido,SHIP,"This vessel was originally a scrapped Hegemony project until a Takeshido engineer won its unfinished blueprint in a street race. Hiro Kao himself ordered the completion of the blueprint and construction of the ship so that it could serve as a modified all-rounder in Takeshido fleets. The result was a ship with great firepower, able to assist in both land and space combat. Unfortunately, the blueprint didn't include a shield, so a damper field was added post-redesign to act as a defensive system.",,,
seven_ontos_epta,SHIP,"The Ontos-class destroyer is an oddity among most ships, a ship purely focused on absolute firepower above all else. Fielding no less than six medium hardpoints, and a flux grid that can actually handle them, the Ontos punches so far above its weight class that it earns the ultraheavy designation according to some captains. However, the sacrifices made in its defensive capabilities cause others to call it ultralight instead. The ship's immense firepower is counterbalanced by fragile construction and weak shields, so skilled pilots find it most effective when it can hang around large, defensive-oriented ships and play the role of close support.

The Ontos design originated from an Epta engineer with a fixation on Old Earth tank destroyers, particularly those with externally-mounted weapons. Most of the previous iterations of the Ontos were wildly unstable due to their weapon requirements, and it was generally considered to be a joke ship. It was only due to recent advances in flux grid design that the current version could serve as a functional vessel.",,,
seven_conflictor_takeshido,SHIP,"During the Second AI War, some pirates salvaged a destroyed Afflictor and tried to smash it together with a Wayfarer. Development was ultimately scrapped when an attempt to use the ship's system fully crashed its mainframe mid-combat, resulting in the destruction of the ship and the death of all its crew. Many cycles later, Takeshido racers rediscovered the fragments of the abomination and brought them to Oashisu. Takeshido engineers were eventually able to piece together the wreckage and get a stable version of it into production, sacrificing some elegance in design for stability and firepower.",,,
seven_kataigida,SHIP,"The Kataigida is Epta Consortium's answer to a small manufacturing base and high demand for a huge variety of combat and logistical roles. Whereas other ships opt to focus on one or two aspects of fleet combat and logistics, the Kataigida takes nearly every aspect of fleet management and puts it in a very neat, albeit expensive and difficult to modify, package. The Kataigida is the ultimate generalist ship, able to adequately perform or shore up nearly any role that a fleet could ask of it and, although its ability in any one given area may pale in comparison to more specialized ships, that degree of versatility is often found to be well worth the cost of acquisition.",,,
seven_selene,SHIP,"The sight of a Selene class destroyer and its pair Iphigenia R-Type drones is often considered a death sentence for nearly any frigate captain caught in the open; Over the years since its development and introduction the Selene class has boasted one of the highest killcounts in the sector bar none. While its built in R-Types slow its prey to a standstill and shred through their defenses the Selene may move in for the kill with its Pounce Drives, overpowering any small fast attackers with its stellar frontal performance and mobility.",,,
seven_agrios,SHIP,"The Agrios is one of Epta's strangest designs as well as one of its most desirable. With its ability to hold a line, reinforce both the offense and the defense of its allies, and project economical firepower on its own while doing so makes the Agrios a prize for the discerning 'shield line' favoring fleet commander.",,,
seven_tychon,SHIP,"The Tychon is a multipurpose tanker designed to support ground assaults and raids with built-in fire support weaponry while simultaneously mounting enough fuel storage to readily supply entire fleets. If ambushed, the Tychon-class can use a long-range phase teleporter to quickly escape hostile engagements, and should this fail, the built-in Phase Anchor allows it to dive into P-space to survive, albeit with the standard costs of such a maneuver rendering it only useful for emergencies.",,,
seven_theraphon,SHIP,"Best described as a combination of the ubiquitous Colossus freighter and the rare Revenant Phase Tender, the Theraphon has a decently sized cargo hold, as well as a Phase Field to help hide the fleet from enemy sensors. If ambushed, it has a long-range phase teleporter to quickly escape, and a built-in Phase Anchor to execute an emergency dive, albeit with the same prohibative costs as a standard anchor.",,,
seven_artifact333_base,SHIP,"When I crested the ridge behind McKabe I spotted it just out of the corner of my eye. I had initially hoped it would be a refuge from the malicious entities, however, when we stepped inside it became apparent that this place was much much more; a world in of itself of glimmering possibility'

Artifact 333:
Codename: Null Prism Shard
Recovery Date: Nov 7 cycle 53
Recovered By: Senessa Fulden, Scholar
Note(s): The third crystalline formation recovered from the polar chirality cave, minimally sentient and relatively stable, but displays remarkable levels of unaided growth and is highly responsive to commands via artifact 235. I predict that it will very nicely help with our lack of fleet fillers due to its versatile nature and ease of ‘mass production’. Turned over to Senior Artifact Integration Engineer Jupiter Renthos on Nov 13 cycle 103 for integration.",,,
seven_artifact667,SHIP,"“I think it’s really taken a liking to me; I spotted it thrice in my room while doing my morning logs and several times walking the hallways plus four additional times while eating lunch with Gabriels. Of course you’ll just have to take my word for it, you know how shy it can get when it’s being observed, but I really take some comfort in having it around; It’s like a friend that I always know is gonna be there.”

Artifact 667:
Codename: Broken Lens
Recovery Date: Jan 9 cycle 160
Recovered By: Charleston Langan, Professor of Advanced Scrying, Travel, and Entity Avoidance
Notes: Now this is a very potent artifact indeed; it has a nasty habit of constantly being in two (or usually more) places at once, usually only being in a single place when all other possible locations have been made unsuitable for it. I am unsure of the exact mechanism behind its abilities, however, it does seem to be sentient to some degree judging by its proclivity to “favor'' certain locations over others (ie it usually lets itself into the mess hall, library, or, on rare occasions, living quarters). Due to the fact that it tends to favor communal areas I am strongly recommending that its integrated vessel possess a large crew complement and be captained by someone which it has imprinted on like Professor McCrae or Senessa. Turned over to Senior Artifact Integration Engineer Alan Parsnidge on Jan 10 cycle 160 for integration."
seven_ananke,SHIP,A step towards complete transcendence. Your strength is vast and your potential is limitless. Honor the trust which has been placed upon you.,,,
seven_hobi_custom,SHIP,"Although the Hobi had humble beginnings as an everyday Old Earth civilian vehicle, it quickly became a favorite among street racers for its simple but hardy frame, which easily accommodates extensive additions, as well as its legendary 3kX engine which could withstand the worst of the ill-advised modifications that its owners subjected them to. In the common era, Takeshido pilots regularly field modified Hobis as makeshift fighters and bombers, and Takeshido fleets often keep at least one hypermodified Hobi around as a testbed for experimental engine upgrades.",,,
seven_camirillo_custom,SHIP,"In its heyday, the Camirillo line of cars were the envy of young adult men everywhere, revered for their high power, stunning looks, and everlasting reliability. Unfortunately, a plethora of new legislation to protect the environment resulted in the Camirillo line being put out of production, but that didn't stop those who had them from gleefully continuing their generous contribution to Earth's already-immense pollution issues. Nowadays, surviving Camirillos and painstakingly reproduced replicas are the envy of Takeshido engineers; their vast engine bays and several times redundant structural components make them ideal for interstellar retrofits and mounting explosive ordnance, though their relative weight makes them somewhat more sluggish than other Takeshido customs.",,,
seven_350x_custom,SHIP,"The original profile of the 350x was designed to assist with its aerodynamics, but its designers had no idea how much of a boon this would prove to be in the vehicle's future. Its unique body design meant that the 350x was one of the first vehicles that were retrofitted with the advent of hovering cars, and when the next wave of interstellar retrofits came about, the 350x was once again among the forerunners. Its wings were initially vestiges from the first round of retrofits, but now they greatly enhance suborbital maneuverability while housing some extra ordnance, despite greatly adding to the bulk of the improvised strikecraft.",,,
seven_bionda_custom,SHIP,"Drug kingpins, A-list actors, international arms dealers, corrupt politicians, supermodels, and overpaid beachside cops were the target demographic for the infamous Bionda, a true masterclass in form. Fiera's commitment to the finer things in life meant that the Bionda instantly became a status symbol for all of the most charismatic characters of its time and beyond. Its legendary style alone makes it the envy of any fleet commander with taste, to say nothing of its superbly engineered retrofits.",,,
seven_BR97_custom,SHIP,"Despite its uncanny resemblance to an Old Earth vehicle of a similar designation, the BR97 is actually a post-collapse innovation. One surprisingly efficient flux grid, one passenger on a light armament, space in the back for larger guns, and enough acceleration to decimate anything in the sector in a quarter mile: the BR97 may look old, but its performance is years ahead.",,,
seven_bonta_custom,SHIP,"Fieras may have been the kings of style, but if there was one manufacturer which gave them a run for their money then it would be Mivelli. After being snubbed in a business deal by Fransisco Fiera himself, Antonio Mivelli made it his mission to put Fiera out of business. Antonio never achieved his dream, but his company made some very fine cars in the process, the undoubted pinnacle of which was the Bonta, a futuristic-looking automobile with exceptional performance that came close to the Bionda's at a much cheaper price. In today's Persean Sector, things haven't changed much for the Bonta; its specifications, battlefield effectiveness, and looks are all perfect rivals for Bianda retrofits but come at a cheaper (if still exorbitant) price tag.",,,
seven_NMW_G3_custom,SHIP,"Nosu Motor Works is perhaps the most reputable company in the sector still making high performance terrestrial vehicles in the sector today. The fact that the majority of manufacturing in the sector is devoted to construction vehicles and spaceships does of course have a major impact on that claim, however, that's not to say that NMW doesn't produce some exceptional vehicles; Nicknamed 'The Beamer', the NMW G3 is a finely tuned racing machine purpose built for pilots that want to face down enemy fleets, wow adoring fans when they dock at port, and look damn good while doing so.",,,
seven_vroomicorn_custom,SHIP,"The Vroomicorn is the result of one of Takeshido's most infamous and successful street racers and his unyielding desire to never lose; after half a fortune spent in RnD and one ill fated test run which claimed the life of 17 the Vroomicorn was born. This hunk of turbos, superchargers, flux circuits, and exhausts can give you what mystical men refer to as an out of body experience, the sheer acceleration of this craft leaves some of its pilots in a near permanent fugue state while out of it, evidently unable to cope with such a slow paced world.",,,
seven_galevis,SHIP,"The Galevis is small scale mech which utilizes an experimental Epta tech procedure that uploads its pilot's consciousness into a VR simulation along with their AI partner. Without the risk of bodily injury to the pilot and without the structural requirements of a cockpit the Galevis instead prioritizes extreme mobility and the usage of its unique anti ship sword; an experienced Galevis pilot is able to cut down ships of any size.

Although the Galevis' virtual reality simulation must be used in order to make use of its combat capabilities, many Galevis pilots choose to remain in them with their AI partners for extended periods of time. In a few cases pilots who have strong bonds with their AI partners choose to let their physical bodies starve to death in favor of living completely within the simulation.",,,
seven_aeolus,SHIP,"A next-gen, multi-role Epta capital ship capable of singlehandedly staving off Epta's numerous enemies. The Aeolus features advanced weaponry systems, versatile gun mounts, and a generous flux pool amplified by Epta Consortium's unique shielding architecture. Its greatest innovation, though, is its Phase Dive system, which drastically increases its survivability and mobility, helping to make up for the ship's relatively weak armor. When its unique features are used in conjunction with a skilled officer and a trustworthy integrated AI, the Aeolus becomes a true menace on the battlefield, capable of facing down entire enemy fleets and far exceeding its hypothetical limits.

The Aeolus, for all its eventual prowess, quite nearly never made it to production. Firstly, after the success of Project Gemini in producing a potent capital ship for Epta to lean on, many in the Consortium suggested scrapping Project Aeolus completely, citing the massive amount of resources that were tied up in R&D for this one ship. Although the later stages of its development did see a marked decline in funds, the Aeolus didn't suffer much from it; the dip in funding was accompanied by a significant reduction in oversight, allowing the developers to really go for broke technologically and implement several key features that otherwise may have been left by the wayside. The bigger potential failing of the Aeolus came as a result of its lengthy development period; Hegemony spies eventually noticed the diversion of funds, and a strike team was dispatched to the Aeolus's prototype testing grounds. If not for the heroic actions of the engineers and researchers in defending the research base, the Aeolus would never have been completed.

On the heels of its impromptu field test, Project Aeolus was quickly finished and soon after put into production. Since then, the Aeolus has garnered a reputation for being one of the more variable ships in the sector; those who can pilot it and work with AI can decimate even Paragons, but a pilot who doesn't know what they're doing may find themself outclassed and overwhelmed by even a couple of destroyers.",,,
seven_buffalo_epta,SHIP,"The go-to choice for medium cargo hauling in the Sector, the Buffalo-class freighter exemplifies the ""Load-n-Pray"" principle prevalent in Sector shipping. While more difficult to maintain, next generation phase coils allow the Epta variant to fly faster in combat space, and to escape pursuit with an unique emergency teleporter

During the very tumultuous early cycles of the Epta Consortium, despite the work of Gia Epta Fthano to show their peaceful intent, the ongoing campaigns against Artificial Intelligence helmed by the Hegemony still created enough fear and hatred towards any ""AI Influenced"" congregations, alliances, factions or other gatherings of people, that the Epta Technologists were starved of necessary resources to even attempt longer term colonization, most notably of food, manufactured supplies and machinery, while any actual exported goods were confiscated to search, many times going ""missing"", and credit accounts of sympathizers frozen for as long as the Hegemony could stall it out for.
The absolute barring of open channels of trade lead to a need for a common cargo ship which could be refit to a stealthier configuration, in order to access unconventional, but non-violent ways of importing and exporting necessary items, while still being capable of retreating with haste should the fleets be confronted by pirates, hegemony patrols, or other hostile activity with the purpose of removing the trade goods carried by these ships, whether it is simply a means to an end, or the means themselves being the end.
The sheer modularity, commonality and compact size of the Buffalo attracted the attention of the Epta Technologist engineers immediately, and work began on the few wrecks which could be salvaged to convert them into a temporary solution to a hopefully temporary problem, with rumors that the first set of Epta coils were infact on a Buffalo, although the exact date and veracity of this variant",,,
seven_kafsima,SHIP,"A medium tanker with enough fuel capacity to support a larger fleet. The security of long range fuel tankers was essential enough to the Epta Consortium that they upgraded their fuel tankers with next generation phase coils. These new coils make the Phaetons both harder to detect, and harder to catch in combat, although the logistical strain caused by phase coil brings into question how effective these ships truly are.",,,

seven_Hobi_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified Hobi interceptor cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Downsized machine guns excel at point defense and applying shield pressure, but do minimal damage to armored targets.

Although the Hobi had humble beginnings as an everyday Old Earth civilian vehicle, it quickly became a favorite among street racers for its simple but hardy frame, which easily accommodates extensive additions, as well as its legendary 3kX engine which could withstand the worst of the ill-advised modifications that its owners subjected them to. In the common era, Takeshido pilots regularly field modified Hobis as makeshift fighters and bombers, and Takeshido fleets often keep at least one hypermodified Hobi around as a testbed for experimental engine upgrades.",,,
seven_camirillo_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified Camirillo bomber cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Dual hammer torpedoes, improvised shields, and high speed make it the bane of Hegemony patrols. Sneered at as a pirate's imitation of the mighty Trident, with hefty logistical burdens and lengthy replacement times to match.

In its heyday, the Camirillo line of cars were the envy of young adult men everywhere, revered for their high power, stunning looks, and everlasting reliability. Unfortunately, a plethora of new legislation to protect the environment resulted in the Camirillo line being put out of production, but that didn't stop those who had them from gleefully continuing their generous contribution to Earth's already-immense pollution issues. Nowadays, surviving Camirillos and painstakingly reproduced replicas are the envy of Takeshido engineers; their vast engine bays and several times redundant structural components make them ideal for interstellar retrofits and mounting explosive ordnance, though their relative weight makes them somewhat more sluggish than other Takeshido customs.",,,
seven_350x_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified 350x long range bomber cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. Capable of raining down volleys of bombs that blows up fighter formations, the 350x excels at heckling attack formations. However, long replacement times confound this otherwise excellent harasser.

The original profile of the 350x was designed to assist with its aerodynamics, but its designers had no idea how much of a boon this would prove to be in the vehicle's future. Its unique body design meant that the 350x was one of the first vehicles that were retrofitted with the advent of hovering cars, and when the next wave of interstellar retrofits came about, the 350x was once again among the forerunners. Its wings were initially vestiges from the first round of retrofits, but now they greatly enhance suborbital maneuverability while housing some extra ordnance, despite greatly adding to the bulk of the improvised strikecraft.",,,
seven_BR97_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified BR97 anti-ship strikecraft cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. While capable of point defense and interception, the BR97 excels at pressuring shields with light needler fire, allowing friendly ships to score easy kills.

Despite its uncanny resemblance to an Old Earth vehicle of a similar designation, the BR97 is actually a post-collapse innovation. One surprisingly efficient flux grid, one passenger on a light armament, space in the back for larger guns, and enough acceleration to decimate anything in the sector in a quarter mile: the BR97 may look old, but its performance is years ahead.",,,
seven_NMW_G3_fighter,SHIP,"A simplified NMW heavy anti-ship strikecraft cut down for mass production from fighter nanoforges. The high speeds of fighter combat make it difficult to focus the phase lance, but the NMW remains a potent if fragile machine.

Nosu Motor Works is perhaps the most reputable company in the sector still making high performance terrestrial vehicles in the sector today. The fact that the majority of manufacturing in the sector is devoted to construction vehicles and spaceships does of course have a major impact on that claim, however, that's not to say that NMW doesn't produce some exceptional vehicles; Nicknamed 'The Beamer', the NMW G3 is a finely tuned racing machine purpose built for pilots that want to face down enemy fleets, wow adoring fans when they dock at port, and look damn good while doing so.",,,

The Vroomicorn is the result of one of Takeshido's most infamous and successful street racers and his unyielding desire to never lose; after half a fortune spent in RnD and one ill fated test run which claimed the life of 17 the Vroomicorn was born. This hunk of turbos, superchargers, flux circuits, and exhausts can give you what mystical men refer to as an out of body experience, the sheer acceleration of this craft leaves some of its pilots in a near permanent fugue state while out of it, evidently unable to cope with such a slow paced world.",,,
seven_garage,SHIP,"Advertised as a unique high speed logistical vessel capable of fielding unparalleled quantities of disposable high speed fighters. Only a fool would invest the credits necessary to inflict this scatter-brained design upon reality.

Despite a complete lack of previous experience with constructing capital-sized warships, a Takeshido supercarrier proposal pulled in investments from several large scale brands (mostly booze and cigarette manufacturers.) In short order, the ""Garage"" became perhaps the single most overfunded development in the sector. Of course Takeshido engineers, being Takeshido engineers, spent the vast majority of funds on extravagant parties, drugs, hookers, and paying off old debts, leaving little left for the actual development of the Garage and subsequently causing the whole project to be abandoned. Any ships of this class in the sector today are halfhearted attempts at a recreation using bootlegged blueprints or a slapped together restomod of a derelict prototype and inevitably are plagued with a list of systemic issues as long as Hegemony tax codes. So why then, you may ask, would any fleet commander in their right mind decide to field such a disaster? Simple: 80% of the ship is engine.",,,
seven_leto,SHIP,"Fragile yet lethal, the Leto drone bomber barrages enemies from close range with guided energy torpedoes. While phase cloak significantly increases survivability, decoys and/or autorecall systems are necessary to fend off point defense systems. Logistically taxing.

The most ardent Consortium founders were often members of the ex-Hegemony diaspora, settling on Ignitus to carry on a crusade against the homeland that spurned them. In recent circles the Burnt Oranges have been overshadowed by more opportunist immigrants chasing a new land of opportunity, but Hegemony defectors remain influential on Consortium procurements.

Classic Burnt Orange doctrine dates back to the first bloody skirmishes against their former comrades, with Hegemony forces deploying overwhelming walls of metal and armor against the rabble defectors. Harkening back to age-old weaknesses of decisive-battle doctrine against waves of strikecraft, the Burnt Oranges joined with abandoned Tri-Tachyon personnel and AI personae to fight alongside automatic fire support.



Grand-grandchild of those desperate hackjobs is the Leto, with more ammunition than armor. Where the first Burnt Oranges improvised by stuffing Tri-Tach energy cells into Khopesh rocket bombers, the Leto is entirely automated and augmented by phase defenses. Pops like a squashed marine when under heavy fire - rarely deployed outside of autorecall carriers. Dismissed by New Zeta thinkers as being a relic of obsolete doctrine.",,,
seven_theron,SHIP,"Fragile missile drone. Fires long ranged volleys of fast guided kinetic missiles. Excellent against shields, but mediocre against armor and hulls. Difficult to replace when destroyed.

Touted by the New Zeta design school as the next-generation successor to the much-vaunted Trident bomber, the Theron ultimately sacrificed survivability for standoff capability. Replacing shields with phase coils reduced weight and improved mobility, but increased vulnerability to aggressive strikecraft interception. With no in-built defensive weapons or shields, the Theron is dependent upon good control over battlespace to give it time to launch devastating kinetic antiship missiles.

While certainly powerful, the speed of the Theron's Zeva kinetic warheads are also a weakness. While effective at evading point defenses, high velocity impactors tend to overpenetrate, reducing damage dealt. Still, despite significant controversy and a failed initial public offering, the Theron can deliver unparalleled levels of shield pressure against enemy ships. ",,,
seven_aegeus,SHIP,"A tough bruiser of a point defense drone. While replacement times are significant and damage against armored targets minimal, the Aegeus corvette has best-in-class shield generators and area-denial energy flak cannons.
Initially maligned as the ""Cheerleader"" for lack of battlefield impact, cycles of refinement led to Aegeus LPCs dominating the escort LPC market on Consortium worlds. When the Aegeus was first released for general sale, Annihilator barrages would sail right by the sluggish and undergunned escort drones, leaving their helpless users fuming in rage or wreckage. Extensive battlespace experience against Luddic incursions and Hegemony raids have led to successive upgrades to the ""Pom Pom"" dual Glaphyra flak cannons, giving them a reasonable chance of shooting down enemy missile barrages and strikecraft assaults. The tactical ability to churn out mini-Monitors in a microforge has won the begrudging respect of battlecarrier captains and trade convoy leaders, despite early disappointments. ",,,

Capable of providing EMP pressure, shooting down waves of missiles, and fending off interceptor craft. Fast replacement times are generally held as sufficient compensation for a lack of defensive systems.",,,
seven_instigator_lowtech,SHIP,"A rare ship often mistaken for a piece of propaganda, a showpiece or an early overly ambitious mockup for a later ship design, the Instigator class cruiser was another Epta ship designed without cost in mind, and in an unusual departure from standard high tech Epta doctrine, the design was originally based off of the Manticore class destroyer as a low tech base.
Each Instigator class ship is designed to operate almost independently as a hunter/killer for anything smaller than it's self, with superior shields, firepower, maneuverability, and uniquely for the Epta Consortium, even armor compared to most other ships of it's class, boasting an incredible amount of battlefield control.
However, the lack of attention to price and maintenance costs results in the Instigator class being incredibly costly to field, leading to vanishingly small quantities of actually deployed Instigators, with it's glaring ineffectiveness against similarly as expensive capital ships sparks debates as to whether more ships, or simply upscaling to larger classes of ships are better investments compared to trying to cram as much equipment into as little space as possible.",,,

seven_skopefetis,SHIP,"One of the many fruits of the Galevis' development, the Skopefetis mecha is essentially as small of a long range strike weapon mount as can be produced. Whil the original frame of the mecha is based on the Galevis, its flux grid has been thoroughly retooled to handle the immense requirements of its main gun. A meager phase coil setup allows for slight defensive capabilities, but generally Skopefetis pilots will find that the best defense is simply moving far far away from their target.",,,

This weapon is best suited to supporting an array of more traditional point-defense or massed with multiple other Glaphyra to create a screen.

In the desperate early days of the Consortium, imports of depleted uranium and reliable point defense feedstock were scarce. The venerable ""Glapper"" was originally a catch-all term for any AI-derived solution for detonating energy cell waste as a make-shift point defense charge, barely staving off the Luddic hordes through makeshift ingenuity. While strictly inferior to a dedicated Vulcan or a properly designed flak cannon, the Glaphyra could be cobbled together from Remnant wreckages and stacked together en masse.

Just watch out for these wildly arcing shells' tendency to inflict friendly fire.

The Flekker is an odd piece of Epta engineering, incredibly crude compared to their more exotic anti-tachyon or new phase technologies. The most advanced thing about it is simply the gun's elevator, able to scale to load the entire package in or to load individual rounds in at around the same overall rate. However, the support provided to more conventional PD weapons allows them to attain a notably higher kill rate compared to simply attaching more point defense guns to the ship, at least during dry trials.

Many ship captains do complain about Flekker-mounted allies scraping off their paint or mildly stressing shields, or fragments of a nearby canister shearing through the unlucky crew member in a freshly unarmored section.

#Planets
bushido_kessekixxx,CUSTOM,"A lifeless and rocky world, the battered surface of Kesseki tells an eons-long story of intermittent meteor bombardment. What atmosphere remains clings to the scarred crust in near-vacuum. There is no significant magnetic field or tectonic activity. Deep regolith, inorganic astral debris, blankets the surface, crossed by lava channels and dotted with ancient lava seas formed by especially large impacts.",,,
bushido_metarurijjixxx,CUSTOM,Hitoreben is the military center of the Meiyo system and the primary manufacturer of Takeshido weapons and armor. The colony sells several warship variants based on popular Takeshido racers and is a hub for the production and trade of products that are hard to source elsewhere in the sector. The lack of security for visiting fleets as well as the abundance of contraband and weapons also makes Hitoreben a hotbed of pirate activity.,,,
bushido_oashisuxxx,CUSTOM,"The street racing capital of the Persean sector. The surface of this planet is adorned with several hundred thousand miles of paved roads, and the planet boasts some of the largest spaceports around. Restorations of Old Earth tuner cars roam the streets and many an engineer has made a killing by selling off blueprints for any kind of hullmod that makes ships go faster. The speed enhancers aren't just for Takeshido pilots; both pirate and independent pilots are fond of visiting Oashisu to give their ships tune-ups. A lot of contraband is run in and out of this world as well, but thus far none of it has been captured by nosy law-keepers like the Hegemony.",,,
bushido_nosuxxx,CUSTOM,"The first moon of Oashisu to become industrialized, Nosu's industry primarily supplies the components used in higher-end ship tuning, but it also plays an important role in countering pollution on Oashisu. Although Nosu is generally a manufacturing center, some higher-ups in other large factions have taken to cutting backroom deals with factory owners for components, resulting in the existence of a small but increasingly wealthy group of industrialists.",,,
bushido_minamixxx,CUSTOM,"The second moon of Oashisu to become industrialized, Ninami performs many of the same roles as Nosu, but most of the components built here are fed directly to Takeshido members rather than the wider public. For the insiders who run this star system, Ninami makes higher-quality components dialed precisely to spec for some of Takeshido's most elite pilots. The Hanso forge on this moon is renowned as the best engine foundry in the entire sector, and to have an engine custom-made here is a considerable honor bestowed by the Takeshido to only their closest allies.",,,
